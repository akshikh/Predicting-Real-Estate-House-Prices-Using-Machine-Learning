## Predicting-Real-Estate-House-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning
### This project provides data-driven decision-making for real estate firms, helping them stay ahead in a competitive market.

Understanding what drives house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, and real estate firms. In this project, we analyze California housing data, which includes features like median income, location (coastal vs. inland), house characteristics, and population density to predict property values.

Using machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost), we identify key factors influencing prices and develop a predictive model.

How Real Estate Companies Can Use This:
1. Pricing Optimization: Accurately price properties based on key factors.
2. Market Insights: Identify high-value areas and emerging investment opportunities.
3. Urban Planning: Guide infrastructure development and affordable housing strategies.

Ocean proximity (INLAND vs. NEAR OCEAN) overpowered median income as the strongest predictor of house prices, emphasizing location over affordability. Traditional factors like room count and population have minimal impact compared to geographic and economic influences.
